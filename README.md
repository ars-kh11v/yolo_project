# OBJECT DETECTION PROJECT USING YOLOv8

## Description

This repository contains the implementation and resources for a YOLO-based object detection system. The project aims to provide real-time object detection for various applications (Car Counter, People Counter, Poker Hand Detector, PPE Detection) using pretrained models. 

## Features

- Real-time object detection
- Support for multiple object classes
- Easy-to-use API for integration
- High accuracy and low latency

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ars-kh11v/yolo_project.git
    ```
  
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd yolo_project
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the following command to start object detection on a sample image:

```bash
 cd Chapter_Running_YOLO && python3 yolo_basics.py 
```

Run the following command to start object detection using your webcam:

``bash
 cd Chapter_YOLO_Webcam && python3 yolo_webcam.py 
```
